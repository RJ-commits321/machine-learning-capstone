IBM Machine Learning Capstone

Module 1: Introduction to recommender systems with EDA, text feature extraction (BoW), and course similarity using cosine similarity.

Module 2: Content-based course recommendation using user profiles and course genres, similarity-based recommendations from BoW and genre features, and user clustering with K-Means and PCA to suggest courses based on similar users. 

Module 3: Build recommendation systems using collaborative filtering methods like KNN and matrix factorization. Predict course ratings with neural networks, regression, and classification models using latent user and item features.
